Crystal Colector Game:

* There will be four crystals in different colors displayed as buttons on the page.

* The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game "Target Score".

* When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score "your Score". 

* The player wins, if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

* The player loses, if their score goes above the random number.

* When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. The user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

* Refreshing the page will reset the game and brings the numbers of wins and losses to 0.
